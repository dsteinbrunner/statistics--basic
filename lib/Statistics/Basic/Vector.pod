=head1 NAME

Statistics::Basic::Vector - a class for handling arrays of numbers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Invoke it this way:

    my $vector      = vector(1,2,3);
    my $same_vector = vector($vector);
    my $different   = $vector->copy;

This module tracks which of the other L<Statistics::Basic> modules I<use> it.
That's it's primary purpose.  Although, it does also have overloads to print the
vectors in a pretty fashion.

    print "$vector\n"; # pretty printed

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item C<new()>

The constructor takes a single array ref or a single
L<Statistics::Basic::Vector> as its argument.  It returns a
L<Statistics::Basic::Vector> object.

If given a vector object argument, this function will return the argument rather
than creating a new vector.

A vector's max size is set to the size of the argument on initialization.

Note: normally you'd use the L<vector()|Statistics::Basic/vector()> constructor,
rather than building these by hand using C<new()>.

=item C<copy()>

Creates a new vector object with the same contents and size as this one and returns it.

=item C<insert()>

Insert new values into the vector.  If the vector was already full (see
L</set_size()>), this will also shift oldest elements from the vector to
compensate.

    $vector->insert( 4, 3 ); # insert a 3 and a 4

=item C<append()> C<ginsert()>

Insert new values into the vector.  If the vector was already full (see
L</set_size()>), these functions will grow the size of the vector to accommodate
the new values, rather than shifting things.  compensate.

    $vector->append( 4, 3 ); # append a 3 and a 4

=item C<query()>

Returns the contents of the vector either as a list or as an arrayref.

    my @copy_of_contents      = $vector->query;
    my $reference_to_contents = $vector->query;

=item C<query_filled()>

Returns true when the vector is the same size as the max size set by
L</set_size()>.

=item C<query_size()>

Returns the current number of elements in the vector object (not the size set
with L</set_size()>).

=item C<set_size()>

Sets the max size of the vector.  Note that on initialization with L</new()> or
with L<vector()|Statistics::Basic/vector()>, this is called automatically.

=item C<set_vector()>

Given a vector or array ref, this will set the contents (and size) of the vector
to match the argument.  If given a vector object argument, this will make the
two vectors match, while still remaining separate objects -- which differs from
the behavior of L</new()>.
