=head1 NAME

Statistics::Basic::Vector - a class for handling arrays of numbers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Invoke it this way:

    my $vector      = vector(1,2,3);
    my $same_vector = vector($vector);
    my $different   = $vector->copy;

This module tracks which of the other L<Statistics::Basic> modules I<use> it.
That's it's primary purpose.  Although, it does also have overloads to print the
vectors in a pretty fashion.

    print "$vector\n"; # pretty printed

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item C<new()>

The constructor takes a single array ref or a single
L<Statistics::Basic::Vector> as its arguments.  It returns a
L<Statistics::Basic::Vector> object.

Note: normally you'd use the
L<mean()|Statistics::Basic/vector()> constructor, rather than
building these by hand using C<new()>.
